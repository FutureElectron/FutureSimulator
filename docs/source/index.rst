Future Simulator User Guide
===================================
Author: Stanley Ezeh

The Future Simulator app is a Windows-based application for interacting with 
microcontrollers in order to capture data for logging purposes and sending commands
for controlling the behaviour of the controller. It is possible to connect to 
the controller via TCP, UDP or serial.
