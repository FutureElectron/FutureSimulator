Artificial Intelligence with NanoEdge AI
=========================================

Once the logs are created, they can be imported into STMicroelectronics artificial intelligence tool called NanoEdgeAI Studio. 
This tool enables embedded software developers to create, build and deploy machine learning libraries seamlessly with mimimal 
amount of data. The software creates a precompiled machine learning library that can be imported directly to the STM32IDECube
project.
